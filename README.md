# Python-Playground



This repository contains a hands-on approach to learning Python. Learning a language takes practice and consistent usage, be it a spoken language like German or a programming language like Python. Through this repository I will try to give an idea of what the ABC's of Python are, how you can form words with them, how those words can help you speak and how you can be fluent in speaking Python. 

I hope this repository is as helpful to you as it will be to me.


It would be a crime if I didn't introduce you to ```Hello, World!``` before we do anything. Once you're done installing the latest version of Python, go ahead and type this in your preferred IDE:

```Python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file with an ```.py``` extension (```.py``` specifies that it's a Python file). Once that's done, run the file by typing ```Python [File Name].py```. You should see ```Hello, World!``` appear in your terminal.
